		A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory.
		We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
		
		- Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
		- User-defined Packages (create your own packages). We created "package Main;" to group our class (there's only 1 file, but you get the gist)
