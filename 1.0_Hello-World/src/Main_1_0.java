public class Main_1_0 {
	
// Class Name: Main_1_1. This must match the filename (Main_1_1.java)
// 			   Class names should always be capitalized and have a .java extension
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

	// Method: main().
	// A method is 
	// Any code within a main method will be executed. Every program must have a main method
		
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
		
		// Method: println: Prints line. This prints a line of text (otherwise known as output)
		// 				    to the console.
	}

}

// USEFUL TIPS:
//   - Every line must end with a semi-colon (;)
//   - Braces ( { } ) must surround the beginning and end of a block of code
